# youtube-downloader

Looking for Description? It is basically in the name. It is based on youtube-dl but for normal people. Plus, you will get most of the beautiful features of youtube-dl with constant updates and somewhat decent **(!)** UI. Apparently this is my first Software and I am looking for the feedbacks.

## Alpha Version Notes

1. It is not recommended to Use the software in this Alpha Version. I will work on the Bugs and Features and will officially release the Software in the Upcoming Days (Within 1 or 2 Weeks). After that You can use this app. But if you are familier with Development and like to do Alpha Testing and plan to Contribute in this Project, Please do so. It will be very helpful for me.
   
2. I still didn't manage to set ***Environmental PATH Variable*** without requiring Adminstration Priviliges.  I am working with that Right Now. I am planning to direct communicate with the youtube-dl daemon and make things work through this. Which will be effective and faster and also more secure. then I will completely remove the PATH Requirement Policy. Until I finally fix this, you have to change the **PATH** using Command Prompt. Don't worry, it is just one command, and required only once.

3. I will release the .exe file after fixing the PATH issues.

4. More Features are coming. Check the Upcoming Section.

5. There are still a lot of bugs here and there. I couldn't give enough time to the project because of Academic (University Life) Pressure. I will continue to fix most of the bugs in a week.

6. **(Contributors Only):** The variable names, Indentations and Formatting used in this softwares are very ugly and not convenient. It is because of the lack of time and sleep I got duing the development. (I feel like a drunk person). Also it is my first project.
